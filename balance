-- Do everything to make kiting in the overworld a bad idea
    -- Every time you kill something, spawn something just out of view, appropriate for the area the player is in
    -- Spawn fast things.
    -- Obsolete now that overworld is decidedly clearable?

-- smaller levels in last dungeon
    -- Maybe?
-- Never go bare fisted if have weapon!!
    - Go weapon if unequip arrows
    - mp/hp regen rings unpowered -- add buff + diff bonuses?

RANDART PROPERTIES:
    + attack vs clouds
    + regen while resting
    + speed while damaged
    + berserk duration

TODO:
    + Dance pants: Cursed, +1 speed, random walk on hit
    + Archer totem -- place totem, starting firing quickly towards it
    + Mage bomb -- place bomb, it explodes
    -- scale overworld to # players
    + send sync data for all objects in view by all players every frame
        + have players send their set of objects in view, if ever objects are communicated that dont exist, do level-wide sync
        + have different sync levels.
            sync level 1:
                no object communcation beyond player positions, level-wide sync if player positions dont match
            sync level 2:
                communicate object positions for any objects in view by any players on any persons copy, level-wide sync if mismatch
                -- Also communicate character health?
            sync level 3:
                communicate full data about any objects in view? level-wide sync on level enter?
    + have network communication during level loading?
        + Tricky AF, easiest to serialize any finalized levels.
        + Just have server generate all levels and lazily send? Long-term.
    + Lazy CSP?
        + Have server play normally, have clients play out of sync, use sync level 3
        + With a separated server, this could work!
            +Major problem tho is newly created instances. Need to have a translation layer to accomodate these instances somehow? Significant complexity.
    + turret enemy
    + Make sure all is_enemy stuff gets put into a proper API
Out there:
    Class that cannot do any damage, just takes damage and reciprocates it. 
    Focus on good health regen, heal spells, summons?
FOR MAGE/NECROMAGE?:
    + Slow down, do damage to all those around you, gain +2 magic / turn
    + FIX EFFECT CODE ALREADY

Necrotank:
    + Strong aspect of hurt back enemies / turn them into zombies
    spells: summon zombie / pain / grapple (hold everyone nearby, thresholding how much damage you can take per X steps, and damaging everyone over time)

Necromancer:
    + Make sure the melee build is no where near as viable as it currently is? Maybe. They cant do crowd control or hard mobs, anyway.
        + OK currently the regen provides them with wayy too much damage. TBH just ban them from using melee is fine.
            + Take away the whole equipment slot? Suddenly we'd have a game. They can do small amounts of melee damage with their damage-back ability.
            + Remove damage-back???? -- I like it, though. Maybe make it a long buff spell?
    => No strength anymore?

-- Randomly decide whether bosses have lanarts, include visual indicator that they do or dont
-- Poison everyone in LOS spell
-- Make enemy go mad, attacking anyone spell (Mage? Mage branch?)
--  
    -- Curse type: Lethargic. When this player CAN rest it MUST rest.
        - Deep sleep -- only wake on hit?
    Item traits:
        + Spawn enemies around you
            + only in big encounters
        + XP bonus on kill  
+ Move the dragon out of that dungeon?? -- behind skull door to dragon lair?
+ Per-enemy # of enemies cap!?
    + Per-room!?
    + Consider what to do about high HP regen acting as another damage threshold already. Currently have two redundant thresholding effects.
    + Biggest cause of runaway imbalance? nah
    -- Spawn fast thingss
+TODO doors always open in dungeon
+-- bouncing lightning attack
+-- Ooze enemy that has combined HP and splits into parts.
"They may not solve all your problems or even any of them (hard to tell knowing nothing about your game, after all), but I was absolutely dumbfounded when I played around with them at how cheaply you can get some rather complex (seeming) behaviors (e.g. put the player and some enemies in a maze, give the players a scent that strongly attracts the enemies, but also give them a slight scent that makes them repulse each other, and they'll automagically split up and surround the player)."

" Dungeon layout idea "
    Hmm what about each dungeon piece has portals that activate when you clear its tiny 2nd floor that acts like one giant encounter
    These are 'left' and 'right' portals and work one way if you dont have the other side activated
    they are located near the entrance so you can gtfo from the dungeon piece if you arent expecting how hard it was
    clear all the encounter rooms and maybe you get an 'up' portal
    Maybe one gives you one artifact headgear / player
    another one artifact armour, etc

"Ranger"
    - manual aiming in direction of movement
    - arrows dont mulch for ranger (RANGER ONLY!?)
    - use mana to make arrows pass through
    - use mana to go hyper ranger mode

"Summoner"
    - can sacrifice hp to heal summons
    - penalty if summons die
    - micro by unsummoning

"Shaman"
    - totems are initially inert
    - support spells make them do things
